In this javascript project I used audio of many cartoon characters.
and also used images of cartoon characters by applying javascript method on click I add the audio on particular cartoon characters
On clicking on image their audio will produce for a fixed interval of time that will happen by using Set interval method.
images are placed at the background of button and just clicking on that button their voice will produce for fixed time
This project is for fun.
